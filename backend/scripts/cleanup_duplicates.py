"""One-time cleanup of duplicate event rows created by re-syncs before Phase 1.

Legacy rows have no message_id, so duplicates are detected by content:
(user_id, display_name). The LOWEST id in each group is kept; the rest are
deleted from Supabase along with their orphaned Qdrant vectors.

DRY-RUN by default — prints exactly what it would delete and changes nothing.
Pass --apply to actually delete.

Usage (from the backend/ directory):
    python scripts/cleanup_duplicates.py            # dry run
    python scripts/cleanup_duplicates.py --apply    # perform deletions
